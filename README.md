### Hi there! 😁

My name is Felipe Henrique from Brazil (🇧🇷). I've been working as Front-End Developer since 2019. I'm passionate about open source projects, I've always loved to produce a lot of content during my career.

In my free time I like  to watch movies (🎞️) and series (📺), to read books (📚), to listen to music (🎵) and eventually I like to philosophize about life with a cup of tea.

Would you like to find me?
